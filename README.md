# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The project aims to identify the heart disease using the historical data of the patients. To predict  the heart disease and what factors were important to lead the heart disease different machine  learning algorithms were applied on the dataset.The project aims to identify the heart disease using the historical data of the patients. To predict  the heart disease and what factors were important to lead the heart disease different machine  learning algorithms were applied on the dataset.Machine learning algorithm that we considered in our study were Decision Tree Classifier, Random  Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression , K-nearest Neighbor. All the models have  performed well to predict the heart disease
Difeerent parameters such as Accuracy, F1-score, precision and recall were considered to check the performance of the models.
THe best model acheived was Linear SVm with accuracy score of 87% o0n Training data and 85% on Test Data.
We Performed the Data Exploration and Data Transformation.
Feature Scaling was preformed and OneHotEncoder was implemented to handle the categorical variabless.
